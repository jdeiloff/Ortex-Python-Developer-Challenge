# Ortex-Python-Developer-Challenge
 Proposed solution to Ortex's Python Developer Challenge

The challenge consists in two programming exercises, the first one is a data extraction challenge, which I have solved using Python, with Pandas library.

The second programming exercise is a debugging exercise, where you have to debug a Python script. Exercise2.py is the original buggy file and part2_programming_exercise.py is the proposed solution.

I have copied the original challenge statement below:

# First exercise
Introduction
Thank you for doing our programming exercise. The task at hand is to use Python to read a csv file and calculate some values. The solution should use python 3.x and no external libraries, only the python standard library. It is expected to take about an hour to complete the exercise.
Data
Attached is a csv file with insider transactions in multiple stocks and exchanges, each line corresponds to one transaction. The file is provided with headers, the headers are self-descriptive, but if you do not know what they mean that does not matter for the exercise. 

Tasks
The application should be able to calculate and write out the answers to the below questions. 
What Exchange has had the most transactions in the file? 
In August 2017, which companyName had the highest combined valueEUR?
For 2017, only considering transactions with tradeSignificance 3, what is the percentage of transactions per month?
We expect a list as per below:
Jan, 10%
Feb, 5%
..//..//
Dec, 7%

# Second exercise
Introduction
Thank you for doing our programming exercise. The task at hand is to fix bug or bugs in the attached application. 

Tasks
The attached code runs and returns an result of X, but that is not right. There may be multiple other bugs in the code. Can you fix it?
